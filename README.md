# my first project
 
Hi all,
I am exploring java in this first project in which I follow the W3 school's basic Java introduction lessons. 
I have no experience yet with java but some familiarity with it through my job. As an application manager I manage a java-based application for a bunch of clients, and I automate tasks within the application using the API, and set up links with applications using the API as well. Therefore I have a lot of experience with JSON and Freemarker.

Any tips for first actual projects, send them my way!
